# BeyBlade Clicks 

### Overview
Beyblade Clicks is a memory game using ```React```.  

Upon entering this application, it renders all the items available for sale on the command line.  A ```for loop``` is used to display the items by product id, name, stock quantity, and price.

### Game Details
*This app keeps track of the user's score. 
*The user's score increments when a unique image is clicked. 
*The user's score resets to 0 if the same image is clicked more than once.
*Every time an image is clicked, the images shuffle themselves in random order.
*After an incorrect guess, the game restarts.  

### Game Objective
Click a different Beyblade image 8 times to win the game.  Beware, clicking the same Beyblade before reaching 8 points will reset your score to 0.
