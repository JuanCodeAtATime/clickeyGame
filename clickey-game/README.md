## Overview
**Beyblade Clicks** is a memory game that uses ```React```.  

## Game Objective
Click a different Beyblade image 8 times to win the game.  Beware, clicking the same Beyblade before reaching 8 points will reset your score to 0.  

## Game Details
* The app keeps track of the user's score. 
* The user's score increments when a unique image is clicked. 
* The user's score resets to 0 if the same image is clicked more than once.
* Every time an image is clicked, the images shuffle themselves in random order.
* After an incorrect guess, the game restarts.  
* Difficulty level is low as Ethan (my 5 year old son) was the first beta tester and happens to be a huge Beyblade fan.  

## Watch the Demo!
